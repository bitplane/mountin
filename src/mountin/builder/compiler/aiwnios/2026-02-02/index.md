# AIWNIOS 2026-02-02 Toolbox

Source-built HolyC compiler and runtime. The C implementation bootstraps its
`HCRT2.BIN` from the accompanying HolyC source; no TempleOS compiler binary is
used as an input.

The toolbox retains the matching source tree because AIWNIOS resolves its
runtime, documentation and build scripts relative to that tree.
