# RISC OS BCM2835 2026-09-09 guest components

Prepared headless BCM2835 operating-system build, including the Pi fixes,
compiled kernel and storage modules, OS resources, exported headers, libraries
and source needed for ROM linking. The system directory preserves the upstream
RiscOS tree layout so appliance assembly can continue the build with the same
toolbox. It contains no 9d binary or application launcher.
